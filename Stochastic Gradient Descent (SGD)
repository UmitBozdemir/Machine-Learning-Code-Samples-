# Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning for training a wide variety of models, including neural networks, linear regression, and logistic regression.

# In SGD, the model's parameters are updated based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to a small randomly sampled subset of the training data, called a "mini-batch."

# The algorithm iteratively performs the following steps:

# Sample a mini-batch of training examples.
# Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters on the mini-batch.
# Update the parameters using the gradient and a learning rate hyperparameter.

# This process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence. The advantage of using SGD over batch gradient descent is that it can converge faster and require less memory as only a small subset of data is used for each update.

# Here's a code sample of how Stochastic Gradient Descent can be implemented in Python using the popular machine learning library, scikit-learn:
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

# Generate a synthetic dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, noise=0.1)

# Create a Stochastic Gradient Descent regressor object
sgd_reg = SGDRegressor(loss='squared_loss', alpha=0.01, learning_rate='constant', eta0=0.01)

# Train the model using the fit method and the SGD algorithm
sgd_reg.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions on new data
new_X = [[-0.5, 1.2, 3.4, -2.1, 0.8, -1.0, 0.5, 1.0, -0.5, 2.2]]
predicted_y = sgd_reg.predict(new_X)

print(predicted_y)

# In this example, we first generate a synthetic dataset using the make_regression function from scikit-learn. Then, we create a SGDRegressor object and set its hyperparameters to specify the loss function to be optimized (squared_loss), the regularization strength (alpha), the learning rate (learning_rate) and the initial learning rate (eta0).

# Next, we train the model using the fit method and the training data X and y. Finally, we use the trained model to make predictions on new data new_X and print the predicted output.
