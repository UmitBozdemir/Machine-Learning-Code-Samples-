# A Boltzmann Machine is a type of artificial neural network in machine learning that is designed to simulate the behavior of a physical system in equilibrium, as described by the Boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics.

# Boltzmann Machines are composed of a set of binary units (neurons) that are connected to each other through weighted connections. These connections have an associated energy, which is based on the product of the weights and the activations of the connected units.

# During training, the Boltzmann Machine adjusts the weights of its connections to minimize the difference between its output and the desired output, using a process known as contrastive divergence. The goal is to find the set of weights that produces the most probable state of the network given the input.

# Boltzmann Machines are often used for unsupervised learning tasks such as pattern recognition, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction. They have also been used in various applications such as image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.

# Here's a code sample of how to implement a simple Boltzmann Machine using Python and TensorFlow:
import tensorflow as tf

      hidden_state = self.sample(hidden_prob)
