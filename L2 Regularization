# L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting of a model. It involves adding a penalty term to the cost function of the model that is proportional to the squared magnitude of the model's weights.

# In other words, L2 regularization encourages the model to find weight values that are smaller and more distributed, rather than relying heavily on a few large weight values. This penalty term is controlled by a regularization parameter, also known as a hyperparameter, which determines the strength of the regularization.

# By adding this penalty term, the model is penalized for having large weight values and encouraged to find simpler and more generalizable solutions. This can improve the model's performance on new, unseen data.

# L2 regularization is commonly used in linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.

# Here's a code sample of L2 regularization in Python using scikit-learn:
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the Boston housing dataset
X, y = load_boston(return_X_y=True)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Create a Ridge regression model with L2 regularization
model = Ridge(alpha=0.1)

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the target values for the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean squared error between the predicted and actual target values
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)

# In this code sample, we first load the Boston housing dataset and split it into training and testing sets. We then create a Ridge regression model with L2 regularization by setting the alpha parameter to a small positive value. We train the model on the training data, predict the target values for the testing data, and calculate the mean squared error between the predicted and actual target values. The smaller the value of alpha, the less the regularization strength and more the overfitting. The ideal value is usually determined using cross-validation.
