# Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are a type of generative neural network that are widely used in unsupervised learning tasks, such as dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and collaborative filtering.

# At a high level, an RBM is a bipartite graph with two types of nodes: visible units and hidden units. The visible units represent the input data, while the hidden units represent the latent variables that capture the underlying structure of the data. The RBM learns to model the joint distribution of the visible and hidden units using an energy-based approach.

# During training, the RBM adjusts the weights between the visible and hidden units to minimize the difference between the energy of the model and the energy of the training data. This is typically done using a technique called Contrastive Divergence, which involves taking gradient steps to maximize the likelihood of the training data while simultaneously minimizing the likelihood of a "fantasy" sample generated by the model.

# Once trained, an RBM can be used for a variety of tasks, such as generating new samples from the learned distribution, as well as performing inference and feature extraction on new data.

# Here's a simple code sample of training a Restricted Boltzmann Machine on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Flatten images
x_train = x_train.reshape((x_train.shape[0], -1))
x_test = x_test.reshape((x_test.shape[0], -1))

# Normalize pixel values
x_train = x_train / 255.0
x_test = x_test / 255.0

# Define RBM model
n_visible = 784  # number of visible units
n_hidden = 256   # number of hidden units
learning_rate = 0.01

rbm = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(n_hidden, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(n_visible,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(n_visible, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile model
rbm.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate),
            loss='mse')

# Train model
rbm.fit(x_train, x_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Generate samples from the RBM
n_samples = 10
samples = np.zeros((n_samples, n_visible))
for i in range(n_samples):
    for j in range(n_visible):
        prob = rbm.predict(samples[i:i+1,:])
        samples[i,j] = np.random.binomial(1, prob[0,j])

# Visualize generated samples
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=n_samples, ncols=1, figsize=(1, n_samples))
for i in range(n_samples):
    axs[i].imshow(samples[i,:].reshape((28, 28)), cmap='gray')
    axs[i].axis('off')
plt.show()

# This code trains an RBM with 256 hidden units on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The RBM is trained using mean squared error as the loss function and the Adam optimizer. After training, the code generates 10 samples from the RBM and visualizes them as images.
