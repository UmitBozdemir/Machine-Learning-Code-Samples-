# Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) is a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the human immune system. The human immune system is a complex system that protects the body from harmful pathogens and foreign substances. Similarly, AIS algorithms simulate the behavior of the immune system to detect and respond to anomalies or patterns in data.

# AIS algorithms typically involve creating a population of virtual immune cells that interact with data to learn and adapt. These immune cells can be modeled in various ways, such as through the use of neural networks or fuzzy logic systems. The algorithm identifies patterns in the data that are similar to known patterns and "attacks" these patterns as if they were harmful pathogens. By doing so, the algorithm can learn to distinguish between normal and abnormal patterns in the data and respond accordingly.

# AIS algorithms have been applied to a variety of applications, including anomaly detection, classification, and clustering. They have been used in areas such as network security, intrusion detection, and fraud detection. One of the key advantages of AIS algorithms is their ability to adapt and learn from new data, making them well-suited for dynamic environments where the data may change over time.

# Here's a code sample of an Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithm implemented in Python:
import numpy as np

class AIS:
    def __init__(self, n_pop, n_features, n_clusters):
        self.n_pop = n_pop
        self.n_features = n_features
        self.n_clusters = n_clusters
        self.affinity_threshold = 0.6
        self.mutation_rate = 0.05
        self.population = np.random.rand(n_pop, n_features)
        self.labels = np.zeros(n_pop)
    
    def affinity(self, x, y):
        return np.dot(x, y)/(np.linalg.norm(x)*np.linalg.norm(y))
    
    def select_prototypes(self, data):
        for i, d in enumerate(data):
            affinities = [self.affinity(d, p) for p in self.population]
            max_affinity = max(affinities)
            if max_affinity > self.affinity_threshold:
                j = affinities.index(max_affinity)
                self.population[j] = self.population[j] + self.mutation_rate*(d - self.population[j])
                self.population[j] = np.clip(self.population[j], 0, 1)
                self.labels[i] = j
            else:
                self.population = np.vstack([self.population, d])
                self.labels[i] = self.n_pop
                self.n_pop += 1
        
        prototypes = []
        for i in range(self.n_clusters):
            indices = np.where(self.labels == i)[0]
            prototypes.append(np.mean(self.population[indices], axis=0))
        
        return prototypes
    
    def fit(self, data):
        for i in range(10):
            prototypes = self.select_prototypes(data)
        self.prototypes = prototypes
    
    def predict(self, data):
        affinities = np.zeros((len(data), self.n_clusters))
        for i, d in enumerate(data):
            for j, p in enumerate(self.prototypes):
                affinities[i,j] = self.affinity(d, p)
        labels = np.argmax(affinities, axis=1)
        return labels

# In this example, the AIS algorithm is used for clustering. The AIS class initializes a population of n_pop virtual immune cells, each with n_features features, and aims to find n_clusters clusters in the data. The affinity method calculates the similarity between two immune cells using the dot product of their feature vectors.

# The select_prototypes method loops over each data point and selects a prototype immune cell for it. If a prototype with high affinity to the data point already exists, the immune cell is updated using a mutation operation. Otherwise, a new immune cell is added to the population. After selecting a prototype for each data point, the method calculates the mean of the immune cells belonging to each cluster, which serves as the prototype for that cluster.

# The fit method iteratively selects prototypes until convergence, and the resulting prototypes are stored in the prototypes attribute. Finally, the predict method calculates the affinity between each data point and each prototype, and assigns the data point to the cluster with the highest affinity.
